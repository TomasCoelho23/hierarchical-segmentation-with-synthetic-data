# hierarchical-segmentation-with-synthetic-data
This project builds on the CVPPA@ICCV'23 benchmark to improve crop and weed hierarchical segmentation using synthetic data. By generating imageâ€“mask pairs with ControlNet and integrating them into the training set, we enhance model generalization on the PhenoBench dataset under limited real annotations
